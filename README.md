# firefoot

Cross-platform Rainmeter through HTML, CSS, and JS.

Firefoot is a redone, updated version of my old school project, [Firecracker](https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/firecracker). This time around, I'm using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) instead of Python so users can write widgets in languages that already exist, giving them the comfort and flexibility of the front-end stack instead of the hassle of another configuration file format.
