# firecracker-rewrite

Basically Rainmeter, but for Linux.

Firecracker Rewrite is a redone, updated version of [my old school project](https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/firecracker). This time around, I'm using [Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) instead of Python so users can write widgets in languages that already exist, giving them the comfort and flexibility of HTML, CSS, and JS instead of the hassle of another configuration file format.
